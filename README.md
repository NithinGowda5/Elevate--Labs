# 📝 Dynamic To-Do List

A modern, responsive, and interactive **To-Do List Web Application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
It allows users to add, complete, delete, filter, and manage tasks seamlessly. The app also stores tasks in **Local Storage** so that data persists even after refreshing the page.

* **Mark as Completed** – Toggle tasks as completed/incomplete.
* **Delete Tasks** – Remove individual tasks with smooth animations.
* **Filter Tasks** – View **All**, **Pending**, or **Completed** tasks.
* **Task Stats** – Displays **Total**, **Completed**, and **Pending** counts.
* **Clear Completed** – One-click option to delete all completed tasks.
* **Persistent Storage** – Saves all tasks in **localStorage**.
* **Responsive Design** – Works smoothly on desktop and mobile.
* **Beautiful UI** – Gradient background, glassmorphism style, hover effects, and smooth animations.
